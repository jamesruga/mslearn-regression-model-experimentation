\section{Regression - Experimenting with additional
models}\label{regression---experimenting-with-additional-models}}

In the previous notebook, we used simple regression models to look at
the relationship between features of a bike rentals dataset. In this
notebook, we'll experiment with more complex models to improve our
regression performance.

Let's start by loading the bicycle sharing data as a \textbf{Pandas}
DataFrame and viewing the first few rows. We'll also split our data into
training and test datasets.

    Now we have the following four datasets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{X\_train}: The feature values we'll use to train the model
\item
  \textbf{y\_train}: The corresponding labels we'll use to train the
  model
\item
  \textbf{X\_test}: The feature values we'll use to validate the model
\item
  \textbf{y\_test}: The corresponding labels we'll use to validate the
  model
\end{itemize}

Now we're ready to train a model by fitting a suitable regression
algorithm to the training data.

\hypertarget{experiment-with-algorithms}{%
\subsection{Experiment with
Algorithms}\label{experiment-with-algorithms}}

The linear regression algorithm we used last time to train the model has
some predictive capability, but there are many kinds of regression
algorithm we could try, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Linear algorithms}: Not just the Linear Regression algorithm
  we used above (which is technically an \emph{Ordinary Least Squares}
  algorithm), but other variants such as \emph{Lasso} and \emph{Ridge}.
\item
  \textbf{Tree-based algorithms}: Algorithms that build a decision tree
  to reach a prediction.
\item
  \textbf{Ensemble algorithms}: Algorithms that combine the outputs of
  multiple base algorithms to improve generalizability.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note}: For a full list of Scikit-Learn estimators that
encapsulate algorithms for supervised machine learning, see the

real-world scenarios, the

\subsubsection{Try a Decision Tree
Algorithm}\label{try-a-decision-tree-algorithm}}

As an alternative to a linear model, there's a category of algorithms
for machine learning that uses a tree-based approach in which the
features in the dataset are examined in a series of evaluations, each of
which results in a \emph{branch} in a \emph{decision tree} based on the
feature value. At the end of each series of branches are leaf-nodes with
the predicted label value based on the feature values.

It's easiest to see how this works with an example. Let's train a
Decision Tree regression model using the bike rental data. After
training the model, the code below will print the model definition and a
text representation of the tree it uses to predict label values.

    The tree-based model doesn't seem to have improved over the linear
model, so what else could we try?

\hypertarget{try-an-ensemble-algorithm}{%
\subsubsection{Try an Ensemble
Algorithm}\label{try-an-ensemble-algorithm}}

Ensemble algorithms work by combining multiple base estimators to
produce an optimal model, either by applying an aggregate function to a
collection of base models (sometimes referred to a \emph{bagging}) or by
building a sequence of models that build on one another to improve
predictive performance (referred to as \emph{boosting}).

For example, let's try a Random Forest model, which applies an averaging
function to multiple Decision Tree models for a better overall model.

    For good measure, let's also try a \emph{boosting} ensemble algorithm.
We'll use a Gradient Boosting estimator, which like a Random Forest
algorithm builds multiple trees, but instead of building them all
independently and taking the average result, each tree is built on the
outputs of the previous one in an attempt to incrementally reduce the
\emph{loss} (error) in the model.
